# Modular Wings
Physically realistic wings made for Godot Engine games. 
They can be added to any RigidBody node and can have animated appearance and disappearance.

How to use:

Place the files in "res://ModularWings" and then simply put the Wings.tscn as a child to any RigidBody.

If you want to make them disappear (in game), call a "dissolve()" function on them.
