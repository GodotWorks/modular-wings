# modular-wings
Physically realistic wings made for Godot Engine games. 
Can be added to any RigidBody node.
Can have animated appearance and disappearance.

How to use:
You should have the files placed in "res://ModularWings"
Then simply put the Wings.tscn as a child of any RigidBody.

If you want to make them disappear (in game), call a "dissolve()" function on them.
